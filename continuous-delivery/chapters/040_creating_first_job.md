* Free Style

Lets now create a simple job using jenkins to run a hello world program.

  1. From Jenkins Main page, click on **New Item**.

  Next screen opens the job configuration page. On the job configuration page,

  3. Add job description. e.g., "Our first Jenkins Job".

  4. Skip Source Code Management and Build Triggers, and scroll down to **Build** configurations.

  5. From "Add Build Step" select **Execute Shell** and provide commands to execute. Since this  is a  mock job, you could provide following sample code,

```
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello World !"
sleep 10
```

Review and click on save to go to project page.

## Building Job for the First Time

Click on **Build Now** to launch a build. Once the build is started, you would see the status in the **Build History** section.

Once build is finished, click on the build number which starts with # . Clicking on the build number e.g. **#1** will take you to the page which shows the build stats. Option of interest on this page might be **Console Status** which shows the run time output.
