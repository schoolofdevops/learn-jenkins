# Using Artifactory To Resolve Artifacts

## Introduction to Artifactory

Following video explains the usefulness of Artifactory to share libraries and artifacts in a collaborated development.

In addition, Artifactory could be used as a local repository for storing rpms, debs, docker images, gems, pythong packages etc.

## Running Artifactory as a Docker Container

We assume that docker image for open source artifactory is being pulled from [jfrog.com](https://www.jfrog.com/open-source/).

Now use docker run command with port mapping to run artifatcory docker container.

```
docker run -idt --name artifactory -p 8081:8081 docker.bintray.io/jfrog/artifactory-oss
```

Artifactory should come up on the following URL.

*http://ARTIFACTORY_URL:8081/artifactory*

```
Default Credentials:
username : admin
password : password  
```

After loggin in you will be welcomed with this page.

* Click on next, You will be asked to set up admin username and password. **Skip** this for now and use the default credentials.

* After that, you will be asked to **Configure a Proxy Server**. **Skip** this step as well.

* In **Create Repositories** page, click on **maven** and click on **Create**.

* Then click on **finish**.

## Integrating Artifactory with Jenkins

Artifactory could be used for two purposes,

  1. Resolving Libraries/Packages `From`.
  2. Pushing build artifacts `To`.

In this chapter, we are going to start using Artifactory as a local repository to resolve libraries from. In order to connect Artifactory with Jenkins, first step is to install the Plugin.

![Installing Artifactory Plugin](images/chap9/artifactory_plugin.jpg)

From Manage Plugins, lets filter by "Artifactory", select the relevant plugin and install it. Following is a screenshot of the Artifactory console.

## Configure Artifactory Plugin

* Manage Jenkins -> Configure System -> Artifactory -> Add

* Add Artifactory details and Test Connection.

e.g.

```
url: http://HOSTNAME:8081/artifactory  
port: 8081  
user: admin  
pass: password  
```

Once connection test to Artifactory server is successful, save the configuration page and go back to the main page.

## Resolve Artifacts from Artifactory

Configure build job, and from build environment select **Resolve artifacts from Artifactory**. Click on **Refresh Repositories** which should auto select repositories. For snapshots, use libs-snapshot as repo name.

Validate that the artifacts are being resolved from Artifactory by running a new build and checking the console output.
