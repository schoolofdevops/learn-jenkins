# Creating  Build Job for a Java Project

In this chapter, we are going to create a job to build/compile a sample java application with maven.

## Pre-requisites

### Requisite 1 - Fork the sourc code

* Before we begin to create our build job, we need to get our source code ready. **Fork** the following repository which contains our source code.

```
http://github.com/initcron/CI-Vertx
```

* Then select the **vertx-v1** branch which has the relevant code.

* You will be making some changes in this repo in the upcoming chapters.

## Creating Maven Project

Before we start to create our build job, we need to install **maven-integration** plugin.

To create a build project,

* From New Item, select **Maven Project** and provide it a name e.g. "build".

* And also if you are using Jenkins as a service on the host (installed using a deb file or using package manager), you need to install git and docker as well.

```
sudo apt-get install git
sudo apt-get install docker-engine
```

* From the configuration screen, scroll to Source Code Management, select GIT and provide repository URL of **Your Repository**

```
e.g. https://github.com/schoolofdevops/CI-Vertx
```

![GIT SCM](images/chap8/scm_git.jpg)

From **Build Triggers** select **Poll SCM**. Lets configure it to poll every 5 minutes using the following schedule

```
H/5 * * * *
```

* Scroll down to Build step and you should see Root POM selected since its a Maven Project. In the Goals and options section, provide **compile** as a goal.

In addition to compile, following are the goals Maven project could take.

1. validate
2. compile - compile source code
3. test - unit tests
4. package - build jar/war
5. integration-test
6. verify
7. install
8. deploy

* Save the job and click on **Build Now**.  Following is a snippet from the output of the build job.
